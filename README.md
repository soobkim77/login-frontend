# Full-Stack Log-In App - Frontend Repo

### Purpose

This repository is designed as a front-end application that uses React. The design of these files are meant to easily replicate a log-in system that entails backend validation, JWT for authorizations, and styling. Within this repo, you will find code that draws out the front-end for a log-in system. 
    The files will include:
        1. App Component to control state and hold the functions required to make the log-in system work.
        2. Log-In Component: A functional component designed to render a log-in form
        3. Create User Component: This will be a near identical form used to create new users
        4. CSS/Material UI will be used for styling
